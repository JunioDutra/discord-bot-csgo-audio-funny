### Game State Integration (GSI) is a way for developers to pull information (data) from live CS:GO games. You can retrieve everything from each user's name, to their HP and armor, to how many bullets they have in their current gun. You can tell if someone is defusing the bomb, what map is currently being played, or how many rounds in a row a team has lost. All of this information can be used by developers to create applications that interact with lights, blinking while the bomb is ticking down for example, creating a stream overlay showing each team's stats in real time, or more. There are so many possibilities with this data, it's all up to developers to determine how they want to use it.

### Section 1: Introduction - Creating and Locating the Configuration File

To begin using GSI, you will need to create a file in your \Steam\SteamApps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg\ folder named

`gamestate_integration_YourServiceName.cfg`

YourServiceName can be whatever you want, but the filename must begin with gamestate_integration_ and be .cfg filetype. Be sure your service name is unique, as other applications may place their own GSI files in this folder, and overwrite your's if the name is the same.

This file tells GSI where to send the payload information, what information to send, as well as a few other options.

If you need your application to automatically place your config file in the cfg directory, while your application is being installed for example, you can find the install location by reading the SteamPath registry key located in

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Steam`

This will show you the install path of Steam, then you can add the rest of the path leading to the config folder:

`SteamPath Key Value + "\SteamApps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg\"`

If your application is unable to find CS:GO in this directory, it could be installed under one of the other installation paths specified by the user. These locations can be found in Steam under Steam -> Settings -> Downloads -> Steam Library Folders.

You application can find these locations by reading the LibraryFolders.vdf file located in the SteamApps folder.

### Section 2: The Configuration File Settings

Inside the configuration file, you will find multiple options to specify where and how the data is sent to the receiving server, or "endpoint", as well as what data is sent.
Here is each of the available settings for your configuration file and what they represent:


| Name      | Example Value                                   | Default Value | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| uri       | [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) | N/A           | The address we are sending the data ("payload") to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| timeout   | 5.0                                             | 1.1 seconds   | The time the game will wait to receive its HTTP 2XX (OK) response from the endpoint after sending its payload. If a timeout occurs, a full payload will be sent on the next heartbeat, excluding any delta computations.                                                                                                                      |
| buffer    | 0.1                                             | 0.1 seconds   | The amount of time the game will collect in-game events (deaths, headshots, bomb plants, etc.) before creating and sending the payload. This allows the endpoint to receive a single, larger payload of data vs. many small payloads, although one is not necessarily better than the other and would depend on the needs of the application. |
| throttle  | 0.1                                             | 1.0 second    | Tells the game not to send another payload for [x] seconds after receiving its last HTTP OK response. Generally used on high-traffic endpoints, especially those receiving large amounts of traffic from multiple clients.                                                                                                                    |
| heartbeat | 30.0                                            | 30.0 seconds  | The frequency in which the game will send a payload to the server, even when no game state change has occurred. This is generally used as a "keep-alive" so that if no response is seen by the endpoint within this time frame, the endpoint can assume the game client is offline or disconnected.                                           |

```
{
  "uri" "http://127.0.0.1:3000"
  "timeout" "5.0"
  "buffer"  "0.1"
  "throttle" "0.1"
  "heartbeat" "30.0"
}
"auth"
{
  "token" "Q79v5tcxVQ8u"
}
```

Auth is an optional section used by the endpoint to ensure it is receiving a payload from a valid source. The key appears to be customizable and is not required to be "token". The value can also be customized to whatever key/password/token/etc. you would like. The fields in this section are transmitted as JSON string fields to the endpoint to use for authenticating the payload, so it is recommended to use SSL to protect the payload during transmission to avoid a [man-in-the-middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack), whereby the key could be taken and used by an attacker to send unauthorized payloads to the endpoint.

### Section 3: The Data Section - What Information Can Be Read

The data section of the configuration file can be tailored to have CS:GO send only the information necessary for your application, by using the available game state components. All of the available components for the data section are listed below:

```json
"data"
{
  "provider"				"1"
  "player_id"				"1"
  "player_state"			"1"
  "map"						"1"
  "map_round_wins"			"1"
  "player_match_stats"		"1"
  "player_weapons"			"1"
  "round"					"1"
  "allgrenades"				"1"
  "allplayers_id"			"1"
  "allplayers_match_stats"	"1"
  "allplayers_position"		"1"
  "allplayers_state"		"1"
  "allplayers_weapons"		"1"
  "bomb"					"1"
  "phase_countdowns"		"1"
  "player_position"			"1"
}
```

Each component sends specific data to the endpoint, and you can "subscribe" only to the ones you need be including them in your configuration file. You can also specify all of the components in your configuration file, but enable/disable them individually by setting their value to 1 (enable) or 0 (disable).

The following section will explain each of the game state components and what information they provide.

Note: The "previously" and "added" sections in the payload will display changes in information from the last payload received. "previously" will have the values of each section prior to the new payload, while "added" will show any new sections that were not in the previous payload. This is applicable to all components in Game State Integration.

### Section 3.1: Provider

When the "provider" component is included in your configuration file, the payload will contain the following information:

```json
{
    "provider": {
            "name": "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive",
            "appid": 730,
            "version": 13707,
            "steamid": "76561197984957084",
            "timestamp": 1563933335
    }
}
```


| Name      | Example Values                   | Definition                                                                                                         |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name      | Counter-Strike: Global Offensive | The name of the game providing the information. Will always be "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive".                 |
| appid     | 730                              | The Steam App ID of the game providing the information. For CS:GO, this will always be 730.                        |
| version   | 13707                            | The current version of CS:GO, which matches the Protocol Version found by typing "version" in the in-game console. |
| steamid   | 76561197984957084                | The Steam ID of the client providing the information, in SteamID64 format.                                         |
| timestamp | 1563933335                       | The unix timestamp of the client machine providing the information.                                                |

Provider information is probably the easiest to explain because almost none of it changes during gameplay, aside from the timestamp. The timestamp changing also doesn't count as a game state change so, for example, if you are only subscribed to the Provider component, you will only receive new information every heartbeat.

### Section 3.2: Player Information

Player Information is divided into multiple components that can be used to pull data from the currently spectated player. The components are player_id, player_state, player_position, player_match_stats, and player_weapons.

#### Section 3.2.1: Player_ID

When the "player_id" component is included in your configuration file, the payload will contain the following information:

```json
{
    "player": {
            "steamid": "76561197984957084",
            "clan": "Clan Tag",
            "name": "Player Name",
            "observer_slot": 1,
            "team": "T",
            "activity": "playing"
    },
    "previously": {
            "player": {
                    "steamid": "76561197984957085",
                    "name": "Other Player Name",
                    "observer_slot": 0
            }
    },
    "added": {
            "player": {
                    "clan": true
            }
    }
}
```


| Name           | Example Values             | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| steamid        | 76561197984957084          | The SteamID of the person being spectated, in SteamID64 format. This will be your (the client's) SteamID if you are playing and alive.                                                                                                                           |
| clan           | cLaN tAg                   | The Clan Tag of the player currently being spectated. The "clan" section will not appear if the player does not have a clan tag on, and`"clan": true` will appear in the "added" section when switching from a player without a clan tag to a player with a tag. |
| name           | Player Name, Player Name 2 | The name of the currently spectated player. This will be your name if playing and alive.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| observer\_slot | 1, 8, 0                    | The observer slot number of the currently spectated player. This section will only appear when spectating other players. The slots are numbered 1-9, then 0, for all 10 players.                                                                                 |
| team           | T, CT                      | The team of the currently spectated player. Values will be "T" or "CT".                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| activity       | playing, menu, textinput   | The current activity of the player including the spectating client. The value is usually "playing" unless the spectating client enters the menu ("menu") or console ("textinput").                                                                               |

### Section 3.2.2: Player_State

When the "player_state" component is included in your configuration file, the payload will contain the following information:

```json
{
    "player": {
            "state": {
                    "health": 37,
                    "armor": 99,
                    "helmet": true,

            }
    },
    "previously": {

                    }
            }
    }
}
```


| Name          | Example Values   | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| health        | 0, 13, 100       | The HP of the currently spectated player. Value 0-100.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| armor         | 0, 50, 100       | The Armor of the currently spectated player. Value 0-100.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| helmet        | true, false      | Boolean value showing whether or not the player is wearing a helmet. Value true/false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| flashed       | 0, 80, 255       | A value showing how flashed the player is, from 0 (not flashed), to 255 (fully flashed)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| smoked        | 0, 14, 255       | Same as above, but for how obscured the player's vision is from smoke. Value 0-255.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| burning       | 0, 20, 255       | Same as above, but for when a player is on fire. Value 0-255, however only 255 (on fire) and 254-0 (not on fire) appear to be relevant, as a player does not stay on fire after leaving it.

| Name            | Example Values   | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| phase           | live, over, bomb | The current phase of the round. Values are similar to the "round" component (live, over, freezetime), but also includes "bomb" when the bomb is planted, "defuse" when the bomb is being defused, and "warmup" during the pre-game warmup time.                                                                                                                |
| phase\_ends\_in | 60.1, 12.5, 3.0  | The time in which the current phase ends. This timer changes depending on the phase. For example, during "live" it will display the time left in the round, but when the bomb is planted it will change to display the time before the bomb explodes. When the round ends and phase goes to "over", it will display the time left before the new round starts. |

### Section 3.6: Map Information

Map Information is divided into two components that can be used to pull data from the current map. The components are map and map_round_wins.

#### Section 3.6.1: Map

When the "map" component is included in your configuration file, the payload will contain the following information:

```json
{
"map": {
	"mode": "competitive",
	"name": "de_cache",
	"phase": "live",
	"round": 14,
	"team_ct": {
		"score": 8,
		"consecutive_round_losses": 0,
		"timeouts_remaining": 1,
		"matches_won_this_series": 0
	},
	"team_t": {
		"score": 6,
		"consecutive_round_losses": 1,
		"timeouts_remaining": 1,
		"matches_won_this_series": 0
	},
	"num_matches_to_win_series": 0,
	"current_spectators": 34,
	"souvenirs_total": 0
  }
}
```

### Section 4: Components Not Covered

The following components will not be covered, either because they are redundant or possibly another reason:



| Component Name           | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

- player_position

### Section 6: Conclusion
Almost 26,000 characters later, I hope this guide actually helps someone so I didn't completely waste my time.. 🙃 I may have missed some values for some of the sections, in fact I'm almost certain I did, because they aren't documented anywhere. To get them, I literally have to play or spectate games and let a server run to gather the information, so it's possible that I missed something here or there. If you know of anything, please let me know and I will edit the post. I may make a followup post with some example code that uses GSI, but don't hold me to it. This was already a project all its own. That being said, enjoy!
